# metapp
Universal app development and deployment pipeline. Included is an example of a generic app, deployable on any device or operating system.

# How to download for iOS/Android
* Download launcher.html
* Launch it from the Metapp bin folder

The launcher should then detect present apps in the directory using JSON magic and give you a nice home screen, then you can hit Voiceapp and there you have it.

### This also works on Chrome OS, Linux, Windows and anything that runs Google's V8 engine (or if forced to, any JavaScript/markup  rendering engine) including but not limited to modified versions of Google Chrmoe and/or any other layout rendering application at any OS or hardware level with or without said layout rendering capability.

## Abstract
Anything with a V8 engine and HTML renderer can run this and it is to be deployed thusly as a local file containing all the dependencies within itself, packed into a web version, with OS integration as a possible extention. The HTML file containing the layout, styling, encoded assets and executable section is the app itself.

All code must be released available within the app's file object (packed/obfuscated or html within executable) and if you find a use for this please let me know because I am so done writing user applications.

Like voiceapp.html could be anything, it could be a Discord client, it could be a game, it could even be a whole new virtual operating system in and of itsefs.
