# How to deploy as a mobile app
* Open in Chrome
* Download as a local file
* Open that file
* Press "Save to Home Screen"

## Basically 
Anything with a V8 engine and HTML renderer can run this and it is to be deployed thusly as a local file containing all the dependencies within itself, packed into a web version, with OS integration as a possible extention. The HTML file containing the layout, styling, encoded assets and executable section is the app itself.

All code must be released available within the app's file object (packed/obfuscated or html within executable) and if you find a use for this please let me know because I am so done writing user applications.
