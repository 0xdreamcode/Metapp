# voiceapp
Universal text to speech.

# How to download for iOS/Android
Download launcher.html
Set the homepage of Google Chrome to file://where/you/put/the/launcher.html
Put voiceapp.html in the same directory.


## Basically 
Anything with a V8 engine and HTML renderer can run this and it is to be deployed thusly as a local file containing all the dependencies within itself, packed into a web version, with OS integration as a possible extention. The HTML file containing the layout, styling, encoded assets and executable section is the app itself.

All code must be released available within the app's file object (packed/obfuscated or html within executable) and if you find a use for this please let me know because I am so done writing user applications.
